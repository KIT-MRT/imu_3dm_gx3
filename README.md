#IMU 3DM GX3 ROS TOOL

This is a fork of Nathan Michael's original ROS driver for the Lord Corporation Microstrain 3DM GX3 25 IMU.

## Adding rules

You can add a udev rule to set the permissions correctly when the imu is plugged in.
Therefore, run `sudo scripts/add_rule` and enter `y` at the prompt.
